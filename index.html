              <p>The smell of toasted cheese, warm pieces and light notes of sesame beckon passersby to the Richmond District’s latest hidden gem. Tucked away on Fourth Avenue around the corner from Clement Street, Batches Bakehouse leads people to its storefront with the scent of freshly baked bagels and pastries. The business whips up about 25 dozen bagels a day alongside sandwiches, cookies and cupcakes. <br> <br> 

                Co-founders Ashley Zografos and Ashlee Thompson were proud to open Batches Bakehouse on Dec. 1, 2023. For Thompson, this grand opening marks the resolution to a childhood dream. <br> <br>
                 
                 “I’ve wanted to open up my own bakery since I was 13,” Thompson said. “I’ve kept a picture of a bakery I drew when I was 13 that I wanted to open someday; founding Batches is just a dream come true.” <br> <br> 
                
                Thompson first ventured into the culinary world about eight years ago when she quit her job to pursue her passion for cooking. She developed her skills primarily in the Greater Boston Area, where she first worked as a bread baker for Boston’s Tatte Bakery. After learning how to bake bread, Thompson focused on baking pastries in Boston’s South End Buttery where she learned to bake cupcakes, brownies and the occasional wedding cake. Thompson then transitioned to baking as a pastry cook for a number of different restaurants along the East Coast. <br> <br>
  
                “I picked up most of my cooking and baking skills from hands-on experience,” Thompson said. “I’m completely self-taught.” <br> <br>
                 
                In 2019, Thompson moved to the Bay Area to further develop her skills as a pastry chef at Michelin-starred The Village Pub; she later worked for San Francisco’s Atelier Crenn and Victory Hall and Parlor. Thompson first met Zografos around this time. <br> <br> 
                  
                “We had met through mutual friends, and the idea just came up one day,” Thompson said. “We just asked each other: ‘What if we started a bakery?’”

            <p>Among the leafy greenery of Golden Gate Park’s Botanical Garden, vibrant sunflowers burst with color year-round. Sprawling with painted petals across a mural, the flowers’ yellow rays attract curious, young eyes. <br> <br> 

              As their gazes continue to explore, they meet colorful chalk lettering that reads, “Welcome to the Children’s Garden.” For budding youth, the Garden’s Bean Sprout Family Days provides an opportunity for hands-on environmental enrichment and eco-conscious awareness. <br> <br> <br>
              On a Tuesday morning, families arrived hand-in-hand, eager to explore the event’s activities, which are available to the public during Tuesday and Thursday mornings and Saturday afternoons. An archway framed the entrance to the garden while little bootprints stamped their way through the dirt pathways.  <br> <br>

Children scampered toward the Mud Kitchen, grinning as they romped in soil and earthy textures. Gardening spaces pocketed within the area invited toddlers to gain new interaction in natural environments. <br> <br>

          <div class="paragraph3">
            <p>In a shop window on Clement Street between Ninth and 10th avenues, a large blue robot stands guard over the entrance to the Heroes Club, with its fists in the air, ready to battle for right against wrong.

              Its name is Gigantor, a veteran from the early days of Japanese animation going back to the 1960s, representing every little boy’s desire for a big toy robot. Hand built by Robin Kwok, it greets visitors and window shoppers at his store, which was recently honored by the City with “legacy business” status. According to the Legacy Business Program, the designation is given to businesses that have been open for at least 30 continuous years. The business also must have impacted San Francisco’s identity and must be dedicated to keeping its traditions alive. The program was created in 2015 to support historical businesses; members can receive grants, business and marketing help as well as recognition from the City.

              Those who dare to step past Gigantor and enter are rewarded with a wall-to-wall pantheon of monsters, robots, weird creatures and, of course, action heroes, all of them given new life by Kwok, who hand crafts his products in his shop just beyond the far wall behind the service counter.

              The San Francisco Office of Small Business, in its Legacy Business Registry Staff Report, said Heroes Club, Inc. is the only shop in San Francisco that specializes in Asian nostalgic science fiction and anime fine art collectible toys.
